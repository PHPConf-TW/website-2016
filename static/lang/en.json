    "content": "<p>PHP has the largest market share in back-end (server-side scripting) languages. It always been the first choice of web developer since it is easy to learn, easy to use, and resources are abundant. Because of the burden of the past, PHP suffer in silence a lot of misunderstanding. With the introduction of PHP 7, significantly improved efficiency at the same time, PHP has gradually reborn, no longer the hearts of everyone that spaghetti code.<p>So this year we will focus on the theme in modern PHP development methods, and software testing. And invited the author of the book of modern PHP Josh Lockhart to share a new generation of PHP development mode. Also invited to this well-known author of PHPUnit testing framework Bergman to introduce us how to write tests.</p><p>Also this year we added a workshop agenda, hoping by doing, lead the construction of CI / CD environment.</p>"

I am also an author, open source leader, conference speaker, and fellow PHP developer. I've traveled across the United States and around the world, and I hear the same question from many PHP developers: \"how do I become a PHP senior developer?\" It's a common question, and my answer may surprise you.</p>",

However, there are other intangible lessons I've learned on my journey from novice to freelancer to open source leader to author to Special Projects Director at New Media Campaigns. These lessons are learned from personal experience, and they are the bedrock upon which I continue to improve my skills as a PHP developer and team leader. I want to share these lessons with you. I want to show you why a good PHP developer must know more than code. Join me at PHPConf Taiwan 2016 to learn more.",
